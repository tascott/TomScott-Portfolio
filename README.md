# Week 2 Challenge - Portfolio
Week 2 Challenge Task

## Description

A starter for my portfolio as of December 2022.

Some minor out-of-spec things include an animation for underline of the links, hover effects, and a pure SVG hero background (which is a topography image as my BA is in Geography!). Also included is a very basic 'coming soon' placeholder page.

## Installation

Just open index.html in your browser.

## Usage

Static site, just open HTML to run - no backed or JS code. Currently uses placeholders for the projects.
